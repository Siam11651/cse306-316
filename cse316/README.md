### Safe n Secure Wheelchair with Buddy App

This is our submission for the junior year **Microcontroller Lab course** in BUET CSE. We were told to make something using Arduino and other microcontrollers. So we made something that can be used by elderly and/or disabled personnel, **a controllable electric wheelchair with 
link to a caregiver in case of emergencies.** We made a prototype system to showcase our idea and study the feasibility.

In the prototype wheelchair, there were - 
- **2 Arduino boards** to control overall system
- **Electric motors** for moving, **rechargeable batteries** for powering and **joystick** to direct the system
- **Gyro and Accelerometer sensor** to detect falls/rotations
- **Sim card module** to message a caregiver in case of emergencies
- **Android App** to control the wheelchair and contact the caregiver
- **Bluetooth modules** to connect to the Android App
- Finally a **LCD screen** to give system status to the user

The project was a team effort, with all of our members pitching in, hoping to make it a success. We also gratefully thank our supervisors, 
[Tareq Mahmood Sir](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/tareq) sir and [Md. Masum Mushfiq](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/mushfiq) sir for their guidance and motivation for our project. With their help, the project ended smoothly and was **selected as one of the top 5 projects in our class**, out of 20 projects.
